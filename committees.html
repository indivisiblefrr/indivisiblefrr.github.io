			<strong>Ok, committee time. Team time. Action squads time. </strong>
                        Whatever you want to call it - this is your organizing call.

                        <strong>Becoming part of the team that powers IFRR </strong>
                        will require true dedication to the cause of rescuing our ailing democracy, + the commitment of a small but consistently reliable slice of your time. And it just might save the world. No joke.
